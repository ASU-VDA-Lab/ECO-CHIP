# ECO-CHIP

Carbon footprint estimator for heterogenous chiplet-based systems. 
ECO-CHIP is an analysis tool that analyzes the operational and embodied CFP (design, manufacturing, and packaging). The tool supports the following HI and packaging architectures: RDL fanout, silicon bridge-based, passive and active interposer, and 3D integration. The tool evaluates the crucial package/assembly carbon emissions essential for HI systems, considering size, yield, and assembly process. In addition, it also estimates design CFP.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

ECO-CHIP requires the following:

- python 3.6
- pip 18.1
- python3-venv

Additionally, please refer to the requirements.txt file in this repository. The packages in requirements.txt will be installed in a virtual environment.

### Download and install with bash

```
git clone <path>
cd ECO-CHIP
python3 -m venv eco-chip
source eco-chip/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Input definition and config

ECO-CHIP has three inputs, including a design configuration file, a list of supported technology nodes, and technology/scaling parameter files which are all described below: 

### Design configuration

The input system architecture is specified in [design.json!](config/design.json) file. The high-level details of each chiplet must be specified as shown below. In the example below, there are three chiplets named chiplet1, chiplet2, and chiplet3.  Each chiplet has its type, which currently includes one of three categories: logic, analog, or sram. The area of each chiplet is also specified, as shown below.  

```
{
"chiplet1" : {
          "type" : "logic",
          "area" : 16.04
        },
"chiplet2" : {
          "type" : "analog",
          "area" : 24.47
        },
"chiplet3" : {
          "type" : "sram",
          "area" : 10.84
       }
}
```
The above file can be extended to support any number of chiplets by adding more entries to the JSON file. 

### Technology node list

The [node_list.txt!](./config/node_list.txt) file specifies the possible combination of nodes each chiplet can be implemented in. The current node_list.txt file contains [7,10,14] and ECO-CHIP generates the CFP for  all feasible combinations for 7nm, 10nm and 14nm, for all the chiplets specified in design.json. ECO-CHIP currently supports the followingÂ nodes 7nm, 10nm, 14nm, 22nm, and 28nm. 


### Technology/scaling parameters 

The [tech params directory!](./tech_params/.) holds the scaling factors along with other additional parameters such as CPA, defect density, area scaling, and dynamic_power scaling values  needed for computing CFP for a given chiplet type. 
Analog, logic, and memory exhibit varying scaling rates [10][22]. Incorporating the transistor density scaling trends from [28][29] allows us to address distinct scaling factors for different design types. By factoring in scaling trends in analog, memory and logic, ECO-CHIP computes CFP.


## Running ECO-CHIP

Modify config/desing.json to the required design with an area for each type (logic, analog and memory). Modify config/nodes.txt to the desired nodes for which CFP needs to be explored across. 
    
The command for CFP exploration across nodes : 

```sh
python3 src/ECO_chip.py --design config/desing.json 
```
